## A simple python based discord translation bot that works by detecting reactions on messages
## [Add to your server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1012428802749648946&permissions=431242030144&scope=bot)

It uses googletrans python library, rest-countries v3 api, emoji library, langcodes library and ofcoourse discord.py

You can find the specific versions that I have used in the requirements.txt file. Make sure to use the googletrans version 3.1.0a0 
cause the other versions have a bug

If you are planning to make your own version out of this, make sure to add your discord api token in line 99 of the main.py file

This is still WIP.

If you would like to give the bot a try or help me find bugs please feel free to add the bot to your server using the following link:

It doesn't need administrative priviliges, It only needs permission to view the channle it has to work on, ability to read and send messages, reaction

It's hosted on a free hosting platform so please don't hit it too hard ^^
